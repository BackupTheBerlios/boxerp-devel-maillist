<PRE>Thanks very much for your commits Jay,
I'll check them first thing tomorrow morning. Just few things: Try to
comment out the commits always and try to commit only the changed files as I
think there are some files
committed just because the file date was changed. These are not a problem
actually but just a good practice for the future.
Jeremy told me that something is not working, I'll check it tomorrow first.
The Validation and ValidationTests are experiments that I started last month
but that thing has not been tested nor finished and it is not going to be in
verion 0.2 (next release).
Sorry about.
I see you've committed a lot of stuff... thanks soooo much dude, it is very
appreciated. I'll review everything tomorrow morning.
Don't hesitate to send an email to the list or to me asking any doubts.

The next Mono Summit is in Madrid on next november but I've tryied to
contact the organization to present Boxerp there and there is no interest so
far. I'd just like to
launch Boxerp 0.2 as soon as possible and let the people use it. I'd say is
very unlikely to present the project in the Summit, we need users, so we
need a release.
I'll prepare an english podcast soon explaining the project to potential
users.
